# Challenge_18

For this challenge I am working as a fintech engineer at one of the largest banks in the world. I am tasked with building a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface.

In this challenge I will create a record data class, modify the already existing block data class to store the record data, add functional user input availability to the streamlit interface, and test the ledger by successfully storing records.
